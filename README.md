# Course-Project--Esteban-Castro
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The script is invented to analyze the data from UCI HAR Dataset. The following files from the initial dataset is used:

features.txt - includes the descriptions for features measured
train/X_train.txt - includes the measurements of the features in train set (one row - 1 measurement of 561 features)
test/X_test.txt - includes the measurements of the features in test set
train/subject_train.txt - subject for each measurement from the train set
test/subject_test.txt - subject for each measurement from the test set
train/y_train.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the train set
test/y_test.txt - activity (from 1 to 6) for each measurement from the test set
